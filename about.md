The GSDN is a **free and voluntary collaborative network** of service organizations ("Affiliates"). Affiliates are non-profit organizations that provide free or low-cost digital collections services to libraries, archives, museums, and other cultural heritage organizations. These services may include digitization and metadata creation, digital content management and hosting, digital content publishing, digital preservation, training, and consulting. The GSDN comprises a [growing group of Affiliates](../all) throughout California.


## Governance

The [California Digital Library](www.cdlib.org) (CDL) serves as a convener of the GSDN. GSDN is governed by a voluntary Executive Committee, and initiates strategic activities through working groups. For details, see the [GSDN policies and operating principles](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MmLI7bESkYuM40o8PEBogzmTpwS9M5qLIYdsPXGVlqY/edit#).


## GSDN and DPLA

Through its role as a [Digital Public Library of America (DPLA) Service Hub](https://pro.dp.la/hubs/dpla-member-hubs), the CDL serves as a conduit to DPLA for GSDN Affiliates (as well as individual institutions). CDL aggregates digital collections metadata at the statewide level through its [Calisphere](https://calisphere.org/) platform; Calisphere content is aggregated at the national level through the DPLA platform.


## GSDN and California Revealed

GSDN coordinates with [California Revealed](https://calpreservation.org/california-revealed/), a California State Library initiative to help California's public libraries, in partnership with other local heritage groups, digitize, preserve, and serve online historically significant Californiana (e.g., books, documents, audiovisual recordings). 

 

The GSDN and California Revealed programs provide complementary approaches to assisting LAMs with managing and providing access to digital collections. There are several key ways in which the programs are coordinated:



*   Collections created through California Revealed are harvested by CDL for exposure through Calisphere and DPLA.
*   GSDN Affiliates are well-situated to advise those libraries in their local area and facilitate participation in California Revealed.
*   Libraries that previously participated in California Revealed may want to establish ongoing, long-term partnerships with Affiliates beyond the LSTA grant year.
*   The California State Library participates in GSDN governance.
