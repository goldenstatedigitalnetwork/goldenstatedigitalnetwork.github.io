The GSDN is a **free and voluntary collaborative network** of service organizations ("Affiliates"). Affiliates are non-profit organizations that provide free or cost recovery-based digital collections services to libraries, archives, museums, and other cultural heritage organizations. These services may include digitization and metadata creation, digital content management and hosting, digital content publishing, digital preservation, training, and consulting. The GSDN comprises a [growing group of Affiliates](../all) throughout California.


## Governance

The [California State Library (California Revealed)](https://californiarevealed.org/) and [California Digital Library](www.cdlib.org) (CDL) serve as a co-conveners of the GSDN. GSDN is governed by a voluntary Executive Committee, and initiates strategic activities through working groups. For details, see the [GSDN policies and operating principles](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MmLI7bESkYuM40o8PEBogzmTpwS9M5qLIYdsPXGVlqY/edit#).


## GSDN and DPLA

Through its role as a [Digital Public Library of America (DPLA) Service Hub](https://pro.dp.la/hubs/dpla-member-hubs), the CDL serves as a conduit to DPLA for GSDN Affiliates (as well as individual institutions). CDL aggregates digital collections metadata at the statewide level through its [Calisphere](https://calisphere.org/) platform; Calisphere content is aggregated at the national level through the DPLA platform.
