## Why Join? 

Leverage the GSDN network of Affiliates to extend the impact and reach of your services. Offer the services at which you excel, and let other Affiliates handle the rest. Share resources, coordinate workflows, and forge new inter-institutional partnerships with other Affiliates


## Eligibility

Affiliation is open to non-profit organizations that provide free or low-cost services to libraries, archives, museums, and related cultural heritage organizations in California.


## Service Offerings

Your organization decides what service(s) to offer and sets the terms (i.e.., eligibility, and whether free or cost-recovery).  While some Affiliates offer the full range of services, others offer specific services, such as digitization training and a self-service scanning lab. 


## Cost

There are no fees for participating in the GSDN.


## Terms of Participation

Affiliates agree to:


*   Participate in GSDN governance and working group/task force activities.
*   Maintain a current profile of service offerings on the GSDN website.
*   Respond to inquiries received via the GSDN website and/or contact e-mail regarding services in a timely manner.
*   Agree to adopt generally accepted best practices for shareable metadata, content creation and digital preservation.
*   If providing collection hosting or aggregation services, and if the content can be programmatically shared (e.g., via an API, through OAI-PMH): reflect [DPLA/Calisphere terms of service](https://help.oac.cdlib.org/helpdesk/attachments/9019958245) in your agreements with organizations that you serve, and make metadata and thumbnails available for harvesting by CDL (for further distribution to Calisphere and DPLA).
