## Overview

Individual GSDN Affiliates establish long-term partnerships with cultural heritage institutions to help with one or more aspects of making their collections digitally available. GSDN Affiliates set their own services, costs (free or at-cost), and geographic eligibility criteria.

### Help with everything!

If your organization needs help with everything, we'd encourage you to also explore the **California Revealed** program, a State Library-funded initiative to help Californiaâ€™s public libraries, in partnership with other local heritage groups, digitize, preserve, and serve online historically significant Californiana (e.g., books, documents, audiovisual recordings). Participating organizations identify and select from their collections, create discovery metadata for the selected materials, and send materials together with associated metadata to the California Revealed Project team located at the State Library in Sacramento. To date, more than [200 California libraries, archives, and museums](https://calpreservation.org/cavpp-partners/) are participating in the project. Guidelines for participation in the annual California Revealed project are[ here.](https://calpreservation.org/california-revealed-2018-guidelines-for-participation/) 

Contact the [California State Library ](http://www.library.ca.gov/services/to-libraries/ca-revealed/)for information about the annual application deadline.
