GSDN is a collaborative network of service organizations (["Affiliates"](../all)), partnering to help California cultural heritage institutions create, manage, and show off their unique digital collections. Individual GSDN Affiliates establish long-term partnerships with cultural heritage institutions to help with one or more aspects of making their collections digitally available. GSDN Affiliates set their own services, costs (free or at-cost), and geographic eligibility criteria.

Affiliates offer the following range of services:

*   Digitization
*   Metadata creation and remediation
*   Digital asset management and hosting
*   Metadata harvesting/aggregation through Calisphere and DPLA
*   Long-term digital preservation
*   Digital collections training and consulting
